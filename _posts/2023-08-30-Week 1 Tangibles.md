“Jupyter command `jupyter-notebook` not found.
rayanesouissi@Rayanes-MacBook-Air ~ % cd
rayanesouissi@Rayanes-MacBook-Air ~ % cd vscode
rayanesouissi@Rayanes-MacBook-Air vscode % cd studentrep
rayanesouissi@Rayanes-MacBook-Air studentrep % cd _notebooks”

When I executed a jupyter notebook in my virtual environment in Arch Linux, the following error occurred. Error executing Jupyter command 'notebook': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

- **sudo -H pip install jupyter**
- **pip3 install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir jupyter**
