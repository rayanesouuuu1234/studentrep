## **About Me**

One of the interesting activities I did this summer was rebuild a school in my home country, Tunisia. Before flying over for the renovation, my father read me a verse: those who spend their wealth is that of a grain that sprouts seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains. The grain is a foundation, the first step; without action, there is no prosperity. One small step in anything can lead to a ripple that bears a stronger effect than the original. I related this idea to Steve Jobs. We wouldn't see and use Apple today if he didn't start developing computers in his garage. The same logic applies to CS. If I don't try in this course I won't be able to preform well in a future job or class that requires coding. 

Apart from that, I love playing and watching soccer. I've played year-round (highschool and club) for a while and have been playing competitively since I was 6. I love watching the games with my father on our TV when I can as well. CSP is pretty new to me, but I love challenging myself and learning new things and build upon them.

## **Why I love CS Tools (so far)!**

### [Github](https://github.com/)

- can share your code with others 
- can dublicate (fork) code
- collaborate with others without overwriting each other's changes

### "Make" Command

- automates the process of compiling and building a project
- In just a few seconds, all your code can be translated into a working website

### VS Code

- wide range of extensions such as Jupyter are available that can help tailor the editor to their specific needs
- In-built terminal streamlines my workflow.


### Homebrew

brew install package_name
 
- I'm able to install, update, and manage software packages
- fairily quick and easy to install as well
