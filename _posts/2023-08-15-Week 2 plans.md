## Week 2 Day-to-day General Plans 

Work on installing the emoji library thru pip with the intention of being able to have an emoji shown on the website. 

Being able to input this code and coming out with the emojis and text mentioned: from emoji import emojize 
print(emojize(":thumbs_up: Python is awesome! :grinning_face:"))

Installing newspaper3k and wikipedia in order to search something on wikipedia thru the website and to be able to showcase a newspaper article thru the website.

CODE: from newspaper import Article
from IPython.display import display, Markdown


urls = ["http://cnn.com/2023/03/29/entertainment/the-mandalorian-episode-5-recap/index.html", 
        "https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/entertainment/jurassic-park-anniversary/index.html"]

for url in urls:
    article = Article(url)
    article.download()
    article.parse()
    # Jupyter Notebook Display
    # print(article.title)
    display(Markdown(article.title)) # Jupyter display only
    display(Markdown(article.text)) # Jupyter display only
    print("\n")

CODE:
import wikipedia 
from IPython.display import display, Markdown # add for Jupyter

terms = ["Python (programming language)", "JavaScript"]
for term in terms:
    # Search for a page 
    result = wikipedia.search(term)
    # Get the summary of the first result
    summary = wikipedia.summary(result[0])
    print(term) 
    # print(summary) # console display
    display(Markdown(summary)) # Jupyter display
Work on making a custom table and changing table from cars to custom.
